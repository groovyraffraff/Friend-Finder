# Friender Bender

##What is the Friend Finder?
The Friend Finder is a compatibility based app. I decided to make it Avatar themed just for giggles.

It will ask you question and then match you with other users based on your answers. You will then see the name and picture with the user that you best match with.

##Friend Finder Will...
 - Ask users to add their name, a picture, and to fill out a surevey
 - A score will then be determined by the answers to that survey
 - Scores will then be compared and the matching user will be shown in a     modal with the name and image of the friend who's score was the closest.
 
 ##How the App is Organized
 The app uses
   - Node.js
   - Express npm package
   - Bootstrap
   - jQuery
   
 Directory set-up:
  - app -> data ->friends.js - the current friends data
  - node_modules
  - public -> html pages
  - routing -> routing code for api, html
  - server.js
